% This thesis, written during the fall semester 2023, is the finalization of the course TMA4500 Specialization Project. The project constitutes 15 ECTS and focuses on introducing a Bayesian variable importance measure. During the spring semester 2024, I will further extend the work presented in this thesis through a 30 ECTS master’s thesis.
% In the process of creating this thesis, some tools that use artificial intelligence have been used. Mainly, I have used OpenAI’s large language model ChatGPT to help me solve problems I encountered when programming, get input on the structure and flow of my text and some help with grammar and spelling. Most importantly, I wish to stress that all text and findings in this thesis are my own work, and that I have not used artificial intelligence tools to generate any content.
% I want to thank my supervisor Stefanie Muff for her excellent guidance and sup- port throughout the project. I look forward to continuing our work during the spring of 2024.
This master's thesis concludes my Master of Science obtained from the program Applied Physics and Mathematics, with a specialization in Industrial Mathematics, at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). In combination with the project thesis \citep{Arnstad:Relative_variable_importance_in_Bayesian_linear_mixed_models:2024}, the master's thesis constitutes 45ECTS, and has been developed during the spring of 2024.

First and foremost I want to thank my supervisor Stefanie Muff for her excellent guidance. I have learnt a lot from her expertise in the field of statistics, but also from her way of working and other aspects of academia. For their generous help and creative discussions, I want to thank Javier Aguilar at the University of Stuttgart. I also want to express my gratitude to my fellow students at the study program Applied Physics and Mathematics, whom I have become close friends with and have learned a lot from. A special gratitude is given to my $\int$-boys, whose camaraderie and escapades have made these past five years not only bearable but incredibly fun. My time at NTNU has been fantastic, and something I will cherish for the rest of my life.

Lastly, I want to thank my family and friends. My mom Marit and girlfriend Emma who have supported me throughout my studies, Aasta for inspiration and laughs, Samuel and Hanna for opening their home, Eli for always welcoming me back to Arnstad Vestre, and Ada, Jakob, Iwar, Johannes, and Cathrine for all the good times. You are all great people to have in my life, and I am forever grateful.
