This master's thesis, written during the spring of 2024, is the finalization of a master's degree in Applied Physics and Mathematics. The project constitutes 45 ECTS combined from a project and master's thesis, and introduces a Bayesian variable importance measure for GLMMs.

In the process of creating this thesis, some tools that use artificial intelligence have been used. Mainly, I have used OpenAI's large language model ChatGPT to help me solve problems I encountered when programming, get input on the structure and flow of my text and some help with grammar and spelling. Most importantly, I wish to stress that all text and findings in this thesis are my own work, and that I have not used artificial intelligence tools to generate any content. Please see the main.pdf for the full thesis. 

I want to thank my supervisor Stefanie Muff for her excellent guidance and support.
