Bayesian framework
Animal model as (generalized) linear mixed model
GLMM 
INLA framework
Animal Model as a GMRF
Parameter estimation




Results:
Fit gaussian traits with INLA and MCMCglmm and compare. First do a simulation, then do animal model? or go straight to animal model?


Fit binary traits with INLA and MCMCglmm. Additive overdispersion is set to 1 and distribution specific variance is set to pi^2/3.
Is the additive overdispersion the same as the IDC variable?
