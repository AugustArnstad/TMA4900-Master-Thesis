# Relative variable importance in Bayesian generalized linear mixed models with applications in quantitative genetics

This master's thesis, written during the spring of 2024, is the finalization of a master's degree in Applied Physics and Mathematics. The project constitutes 45 ECTS combined from a project and master's thesis, and introduces a Bayesian variable importance measure for GLMMs. Please see the main pdf for the full thesis.

I want to thank my supervisor Stefanie Muff for her excellent guidance and support.
